## Contributing

It is easy to add support of other PHP static code analysers.
You have to implement `PluginRunnerInterface`, write functional tests and thats it.

Before you create a pull request to submit your contribution, you must:
 - run tests and be sure everything is ok.

### How to run tests

```bash
make test
```
